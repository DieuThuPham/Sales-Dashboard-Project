I. Audience
This dashboard is designed for the Operations Manager, who is responsible for overseeing sales performance, store efficiency, and product portfolio management across multiple locations.

II. Purpose of the Dashboard
The dashboard helps the manager track key operational metrics, including:
* Total sales revenue
* Number of transactions and product quantities sold
* Performance by store location and product category
* Sales trends by month
Overall, it supports strategic decisions related to inventory planning, staff allocation, promotional campaigns, and product focus adjustments.

III. Methods
Tools Used: Power BI
Steps: 
1. Data Preparation: Employed DAX formulas to clean and filter transaction-level data
2. Calculate KPIs (Total Sales, %GT Sales)
3. Aggregate sales by time, location, and category

IV. Overview
Overview of Sales Performance
1. Sales followed a clear upward trajectory from January to June, with revenue nearly tripling from the start of the year—highlighting strong seasonality and possible campaign or weather-related drivers.
2. Coffee and Tea consistently led performance, generating over 60% of total sales, confirming their role as the shop’s core offerings.
3. Sales distribution across Astoria, Hell’s Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan was nearly equal, reflecting stable demand across all locations and no major operational disparities.

V. Detailed Sales Performance
Monthly Sales Trend:
* Sales began low in January (61.9K) and February (78.2K)—a common post-holiday slowdown, possibly compounded by lower foot traffic or reduced promotional activity.
* From March to April, sales gradually improved, suggesting the start of seasonal recovery.
* A significant jump occurred in May (174.4K) and June (184.3K), potentially tied to strategic promotions, warmer weather increasing café visits, or school holidays driving family and youth traffic.

Product Category Breakdown:
* Coffee (253.45K) and Tea (183.47K) are the most purchased items by a wide margin.
* Bakery (116.83K) supports secondary sales, while Flavours and Packaged Chocolate underperformed consistently across all months.

Store Comparison:
* Sales were evenly distributed: Transaction volume also followed this balance, indicating similar customer inflow and performance potential across branches.

  VI. Recommendations for Operations Manager
1. Seasonal Demand Management:
* Prepare for the Q2 peak (May–June) by increasing inventory, staff hours, and marketing efforts in advance.
* Implement targeted campaigns in Q1 (Jan–Feb) to counteract low sales—consider loyalty programs, seasonal drink launches, or bundle discounts.

2. Product Strategy Optimization:
* Double down on Coffee and Tea: invest in new flavors, combo deals, and loyalty points for repeat purchases.
* Evaluate underperforming categories for repositioning or replacement; explore customer feedback or merchandising improvements.

3. Operational Consistency and Experimentation:
* Leverage the uniform store performance to test new initiatives (e.g., mobile ordering, seasonal offerings) in any branch.
* Use balanced sales as a signal to ensure even support across locations in terms of training, supply chain, and performance monitoring.
